# Coursing Field Project
Nowadays, there are many children that lack of quality education, or even lack of chance of education.  At the same time, there are also many instructors who don’t have a chance to spread their education skills to other children.  We believe that the children today, will lead the world in the future and we also believe that every child deserves a chance of education.  With this problem in our hand, our organization decides to create the medium to connect the educators and the learners together with this website called “Coursing Field”.
